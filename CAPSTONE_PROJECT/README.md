# Project Catalyst
> US Federal body for Toursim Management(USATM) has hired my organisation Rusty's Analtics & Data Consulting(RADC) to be part of Project Catalyst. The project requires our team to extract, transform & load immigration, states & tourist arrival data to tables. USATM has an advanced analytics team that would like to run use cases such as identifying cities with most tourist footfall and then accordingly allocate budgets for marketing/advertising spend for the upcoming tourist season. RADC team is on board and will be using cuttin-edge tools as necessary to provide the best solution at minimum cost.
